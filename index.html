        <p>I was born and raised in Arizona. After graduating from high school, I continued my education at GCC. I graduated from GCC in 2012. I've realized since that in order to further my career I need to continue to acquire in demand skills. I'm very eager to learn as much as possible from this program and am grateful for the opportunity.</p>
